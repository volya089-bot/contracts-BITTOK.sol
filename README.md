# BITTOK (BITTOK) — A High-Speed Deflationary Token with Bitcoin Economics

BITTOK is a high-performance experimental ERC-20 token inspired by Bitcoin’s economic model. It is deployed on Ethereum Sepolia Testnet and aims to offer deflationary supply mechanics with Bitcoin-style halving and 8 decimal precision, while maintaining significantly faster transaction speeds — even surpassing Solana.

## 📌 Notes

- Token is currently deployed on Sepolia for testing and development.
- Future integration with additional blockchains (e.g., Monad, Avalanche, etc.) is under consideration.
- A halving mechanism will be introduced via updated smart contracts or off-chain logic to follow Bitcoin’s supply curve.
